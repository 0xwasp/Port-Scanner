A dead-simple Python script that scans for open TCP ports on a target host.
I made this to learn sockets, networking, and to get a feel for how port scanning actually works under the hood (no magic, just code).

What It Does
Takes a hostname or IP

Resolves it
 
Scans ports 1â€“1023

Tells you which ones are open, with zero sugarcoating

Why?

Practicing sockets in Python

Understanding connect_ex

Getting used to timeouts and error handling

Because nmap is cool but writing your own is cooler
